# Portfolio-One

This is the comment section for my Portfolio first draft 

Struggling so far with submitting the form, when I click submit the formspree is coming up with an error. This is a bug I can probably fix by playing around with it more.

Will still need to work out media queries, not keen on that, looks like a huge job to do and is my main concern.
