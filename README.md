# Portfolio-One

Welcome to my new portfolio! This has been built using just HTML and CSS/SCSS

This was my first project on the _nology course, and has been modified to better reflect my abilities and now includes links to my other projects on GitHub.

My biggest initial challenge with this project was media queries so I could adjust my web document to accomodate different screen sizes. Another challenge was keeping code tidy, which has been helped vastly by the installation of Prettier.
